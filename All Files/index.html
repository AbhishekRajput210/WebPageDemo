                <h4 style="text-align: center;">Director: Priyadarshan<br>
                Cast: Akshay Kumar, Sunil Shetty, Paresh Rawal, Tabu</h4><br>
                <p class="center" style="text-align: justify;">The story of this laugh riot is adapted from the 1989 Malayalam film Ramji Rao Speaking which was based on the 1971 television film See The Man Run. A sequel Phir Hera Pheri was released in 2006. The comedy revolved around a wrong number being answered which leads to all kinds of misadventures. Babu Bhaiya (Paresh Rawal), a kind-hearted garage owner has two tenants, Raju (Akshay Kumar), who is indulging in get rich quick schemes all the time and Shyam (Suni Shetty), who has come to the city to get a job in place of his deceased father. One day Kabeera (Gulshan Grover) gives a ransom call to the owner of Star Fisheries, Mr Devi Prasad (Kulbhushan Kharbanda). The call, however, gets connected to Babu Bhaiya. Kabeera, informs that his granddaughter Rinku is kidnapped and asks for a ransom. When Raju gets to know this, he calls Devi Prasad pretending to be Kabira and asks for an even bigger amount. This leads them to all kinds of mayhem but in the end, they thankfully end up rescuing Rinku and also get rich in the process.</p>

                <h4 style="text-align: center;">Director: AR Murugadoss<br>
                Cast: Akshay Kumar, Sonakshi Sinha, Sumeet Raghavan, Freddy Daruwala, and Govinda</h4><br>
                <p class="center" style="text-align: justify;">It is a remake of the Tamil film Thuppakki (2012). Virat Bakshi (Akshay Kumar) is a captain in DIA, a secret branch of the army. He comes to Mumbai on a holiday and his parents want him to get married. He meets Saiba Thapar (Sonakshi Sinha) at their insistence and rejects them at first but later promptly falls in love with her. His matrimonial plans are all shot to hell when he gets wind of a terrorist plot to target Mumbai through sleeper cells. He activates his own team in the city and goes about countering the plans of the terrorists. Saiba becomes his emotional anchor amidst all this. A cat and mouse game ensues between him and Shadab Ali Farooqui (Freddy Daruwala), which ends with Virat putting an end to Shadab’s agents once and for all. The film was admired for its stylised action. The climax scene where Akshay takes apart Freddy Daruwala and his goons alone is worth the price of the ticket.</p>

                <h4 style="text-align: center;">Director: Neeraj Vora<br>
                Cast: Akshay Kumar, Sunil Shetty, Paresh Rawal</h4><br>
                <p class="center" style="text-align: justify;">
                Neeraj Vora took over the director’s reins from Priyadarshan and Bipasha Basu and Rimi Sen were the new additions to the film. The central plot takes inspiration from the Hollywood film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Raju is conned by Anuradha (Bipasha Basu), to invest his money in a 21-day double your money scheme. He also convinces Babu Bhaiyya (Paresh Rawal) and Shyam (Sunil Shetty) to invest in it. They even sell their lavish bungalow for that. He even asks a small-time goon, Pappu (Rajpal Yadav) to contribute 20 lakhs towards the scheme. They are asked by Pappu’s boss Tiwari (Sharat Saxena), to cough up the money soon otherwise they’ll be killed. They come across a drug consignment and go to a middleman Kachara Seth (Manoj Joshi), who arranges to unknowingly sell it to same mafia guys whom the drugs were meant for. The whole shebang ends in a circus where Raju, Shyam and Babu Bhaiyya escape with three ancient guns worth crores. The film ends just when Raju is poised to throw the guns in a river.</p>

                <p>Pressing on the often-repeated phrase on the roads “Sadak kya tere baap ki hain” filmstar and road safety brand ambassador Akshay Kumar kick-started his awareness campaign for the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.<br><br>
                Kumar, who is known for his daredevil stunts, said the subject of road safety was close to his heart and therefore he was lending support to the cause as a citizen. “I am promoting this cause as Brand India and not Brand Akshay Kumar.” <br><br>
                The event was organized by the ministry for spreading awareness about road safety for which Kumar was roped in for promotion campaign in February this year. <br><br>
                Kumar, along with filmmaker R Balkhasve shot three videos with an underlying message on road safety, which is sent in a light-hearted way to the viewer. <br><br>
                “I feel that often such messages when sent through documentaries get lost as the viewers usually don’t absorb their essence. With these advertisements we have tried to spread awareness in a light-hearted yet impactful way,” Kumar said.</p>

The campaign is a part of a social movement – Niine that has been conceived by social entrepreneur Amar Tulsiyan with a hope to empower women, raise awareness about menstrual hygiene and tackle the taboos associated with menstruation in the country.<br><br>
